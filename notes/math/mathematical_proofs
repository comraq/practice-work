--------------------
Inductive Reasoning:
- the method of reasoning based on making inferences and conclusions from
  observations to a more general conclusion or future event

--------------------
Deductive Reasoning:
- the method of reasoning where a conclusion is reached by logical arguments
  based on a collection of assumptions

----------------
Axiom/Postulate:
- a mathematical statement that is taken to be self-evidently true without
  proof
- these are basic building blocks from which all theorems are proved

-----------------------
Mathematical Definition:
- a statement that gives precise meaning to a mathematical concept, word or
  term
- it characterizes the meaning of the word by giving all the properties and
  only those properties that must be true

-----------
Conjecture:
- any mathematical statement that has not yet been proved or disproved

------
Proof:
- a proof of a mathematical result is a sequence of rigorous mathematical
  arguments that are presented in a clear and concise fashion
- convincingly demonstrates the truth of a given result

--------
Theorem:
- any mathematical statement that can be shown to be true using accepted
  logical and mathematical arguments

------
Lemma:
- a minor result whose sole purpose is to help in proving a theorem
- any provable result that is used primarily as a necessary step in the
  proof of another theorem
- a stepping stone on the path to proving a theorem
- very occasionally lemmas can take on a "life of their own" (Zorn's lemma,
  Urysohn's lemma, Burnside's lemma, Sperner's lemma)

----------
Corollary:
- a theorem that can be stated as a special case of a more general theorem
- a result in which the (usually short) proof relies heavily on a given
  theorem
- often say that "this is a corollary of Theorem A"

------
Claim:
- an assertion that is then proved
- often used like an informal lemma

------------------------------
Logical Statement/Proposition:
- a declarative sentence that is either true or false

-----------------------
Propositional Function:
- a declarative sentence 'P(x)' involving a variable 'x' that takes on
  values in a set 'Delta' is said to be a "propositional function" if and
  only if 'P(x)' has a well-defined truth value for each value of 'x' in
  'Delta'
- the set 'Delta' is called the "domain" of the propositional function 'P(x)'

-------------------------------------
Variables in Propositional Functions:
- any term in a propositional function whose value is not explicitly stated,
  implied or understood and whose value is needed in order to determine the
  truth or falsity of the propostion
- the values of a variable is called the "domain" of the propositional
  function and is denoted by 'Delta'

-------------------
Compound Statement:
- combined from simple logical statements that is based on more than one
  object and the use of logical operators

------------------
Logical Operators:
- Let 'P' and 'Q' be statements:
  - 'P AND Q' is called the "conjunction" or "meet" of the statements 'P'
    and 'Q'
  - 'P OR Q' is called the "disjunction" or "join" of the statements 'P' and
    'Q'
  - 'NOT P' is called the "negation" of the statement 'P'

----------
Tautology:
- a statement that is always true for all of its states of nature

--------------
Contradiction:
- a statement that is always false for all of its states of nature

---------------------
Logically Equivalent:
- two statements 'X' and 'Y' are "logically equivalent" when they have
  identitcal truth tables

----------------------
Conditional Statement:
- let 'P' and 'Q' be statements, then the declarative sentence "P implies Q"
  is called a "conditional statement"

-------------------------
Converse Statement:
- the converse of the statement "P implies Q" is "Q implies P"
- Note: a statement and its converse are not logically equivalent

-------------------------
Contrapositive Statement:
- the contrapositive of the statement "P implies Q" is "not P implies not Q"
- Note: a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent

------------------------
Biconditional Statement:
- let 'P' and 'Q' be statements, the "biconditional statement" is "P if and
  only if Q", or "P iff Q"
- Note: "P iff Q" is only true if both "P implies Q" and its converse "Q
        implies P" is true

-------------------------
Universal Quantification:
- clauses for universal quantification include:
  - for every
  - for each
  - for all
- Note: negating a statement with an universal quantifier is a statement
        with an existential quantifier with the associated propositional
        function negated

---------------------------
Existential Quantification:
- clauses for existential quantification include:
  - there exists
  - there is at least one
  - there is some
- Note: negating a statement with an existential quantifier is a statement
        with an universal quantifier with the associated propositional function
        negated

-------------
Direct Proofs:
- prove "If H then C", that is "H implies C"
- Forward Direct Approach:
  - assume that the hypothesis 'H' is true
  - proceeds forward with a sequence of logical arguments that leads to
    the conclusion 'C'
- Proof By Contrapositive:
  - state the contrapositive to prove; "If not C then not H",
    "not C implies not H"
  - assume the conclusion 'C' is false: ie "not C" is true
  - proceeds forward using the forward directoy approach that
    eventually leads to the negation of the hypothesis 'H'
    ie: "not H" is true

----------------
Indirect Proofs:
- also known as "the method of indirect proof", "reductio ad absurdum"
- prove "If H then C", that is "H implies C"
- assume the hypothesis 'H' is true and conclusion 'C' is false
  ie: "H and not C", "not (H implies C)"
- proceeds forward with a sequence of logical arguments until a
  contradiction is formed
- Note: that proving "not (H implies C)" is always false (a contradiction)
        is logically equivalent to proving that "H implies C" is true
- also known as "proof by contradiction"

-----------------------
Mathematical Induction:
- a special type of direct proof that can often be used with theorems of the
  nature:
    - "The statement P(n) holds for every natural number n"
    - ie: holds for a statement indexed by 'n' for all n in the set of
          natural numbers
- Weak Induction:
  - prove "P(n) holds for all n in the set of natural numbers"
  - Initial Step (Base Case):
    - show P(1) is true
  - Induction Step:
    - if P(k) is true for an arbitrary but fixed (ABF) value of k in the set
      of natural numbers, then it follows that P(k+1) is also true
- Strong Induction:
  - same as "Weak Induction" except in the Induction Step:
    - instead of assuming only P(k) is true, assume that P(1), ..., P(k) are
      all true for an arbitrary but fixed (ABF) value of k in the set of
      natural numbers
- Note: "Weak" and "Strong" inductions are logically equivalent to each
        other
- in general, attempt a proof with weak induction, if a stronger inductive
  hypthothesis is required, use strong induction
- it is important that the initial step must lead to the induction step
  ie: P(1) leads to P(2), P(1) is true leads to P(2) being true

------------------
Uniqueness Proofs:
- Uniqueness Theorem:
  - a special theorem of the nature:
      "Object A that is an element of the set C is the only (unique) object
       having a property P"
  - shows that one and only one object has the special property 'P'
- uniqueness theorems in general can be proved via proof by contradiction:
  - show object A in C has property P
  - assume A is not unique
    ie: another object B in C exists with property P
        where B /= A
  - using logical arguments, show that B = A

-----------------
Existence Proofs:
- Existence Theorem:
  - a special theorem of the nature:
      "There exists an object A that is an element of the set C that has
       property P"
- proof of an existence theorem requires showing that there exists an object
  A in C that has the property P
  - simple as creating an object A in C with property P
- Note: may require a great deal of creative thinking and mathematical
        insight to construct/create the object required for the proof
        - it is not unusual that a mathematical trick or an uncommon
          approach is required to construct the object

---------------
Proof by Cases:
- if the path of the logical arguments leads to a statement involving an
  either/or statement such as conditions S1 or condition S2, it is often
  useful to consider separate proofs for each of the cases
- Note: there may be more than 2 cases
- if the same arguments are used for proofs of two or more cases, then the
  cases should be combined into a single case
  - usually a "without loss of generality" (WLOG) statement is issued to
    shorten the proof of a similar case

-------------------------------
Proving Biconditional Theorems:
- biconditional theorems are of the form:
    "H if and only if C"
- to prove a biconditional theorem, both "H implies C" and "C implies H"
  needs to be proved

------------------------
Disproving a Conjecture:
- since conjectures are not yet proven, they can be disproved
- a "counterexample" is used to disprove a conjecture
- a "counterexample" to the conjecture "H implies C" is a specific example
  where the hypothesis 'H' is ture, but conclusion 'C' is false
- Note: only a single counterexample is needed to disprove a conjecture

------------------------------------
General Remarks on Proving Theorems:
- no method of proof begins with the assumption that the conclusion 'C' is true
- no method of proof begins with the assumption that the hypothesis 'H' is false
- forward direct proofs begin with the assumption that 'H' is true
- indirect proofs (proofs by contradiction) begin with the assumption that
  'H' is true, 'C' is false
- a proof may be broken down into distinct cases
- mathematical induction is often useful in proving a mathematial result of
  the natrue "P(n), for all n in the set of natural numbers"
- both "H implies C" and "C implies H" must be proven for biconditional
  theorems
- if a conjecture cannot be proved, it may be false. To disprove, provide a
  counterexample

----------------
Binary Operator:
- a binary operator 'o' is a rule defined on a set 'Omega' that assigns to
  the objects a, b in 'Omega' an object 'c'

------------------------
Commutative and Abelian:
- a binary operator 'o' is said to be commutative on a set 'Omega' and is
  called an "Abelian operator" if and only if:
    a o b = b o a, for all a, b in 'Omega'
- to prove:
  - let a, b be arbitrary but fixed elements in 'Omega'
  - compute "a o b" and "b o a"
  - show that "a o b = b o a"

------------
Associative:
- a binary operator 'o' is said to be an "associative operator" on a set
  'Omega' if and only if:
    (a o b) o c = a o (b o c), for all a, b, c in 'Omega'
- to prove:
  - let a, b, c be arbitrary but fixed elements in 'Omega'
  - compute "(a o b) o c" and "a o (b o c)"
  - show that "(a o b) o c = a o (b o c)"

--------
Closure:
- a set 'Omega' is said to be "closed" under a binary operator 'o' if and
  only if:
    a o b is in 'Omega' whenever a and b are in 'Omega'
- to prove:
  - let a, b be arbitrary but fixed elements in 'Omega'
  - compute "a o b"
  - show that "a o b is in 'Omega'"

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Common/Useful Axioms for Addition and Multiplication of Real Numbers:
- a + b       = b + a
- a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c
- a + 0       = a
- a + (-a)    = 0
- the set of naturals, integers and reals are closed under addition

- a b     = b a
- a (b c) = (a b) c1
- a x 1   = a
- the set of naturals, integers and reals are closed under multiplication

-----------------
Identity Element:
- an element 'e' in 'Omega' is said to be an "identity element" nder the
  binary operator 'o' if and only if for every element 'a' in 'Omega':
    "a o e = e o a = a"
- in order for 'e' to be an identity element, 'e' must satisfy the following
  three conditions:
  1) e is in 'Omega'
  2) a o e = a, for all a in 'Omega'
  3) e o a = a, for all a in 'Omega'
  ie: the identity element 'e' must be in 'Omega' and also commute with
      every element in 'Omega'
- Note: if the binary operator 'o' is "Abelian", only conditions '1)' and
        '2)' or '3)' is necessary
- to prove:
  - let 'a' in 'Omega' be arbitrary but fixed
  - compute "a o x" and "x o a"
  - solve for 'x' where "a o x = a = x o a"
  - show that 'x' in 'Omega' does not depend on 'a'
  - conclude "e = x' is an identity element in 'Omega' under the binary
    operator 'o'
- Theorem:
  - if 'Omega' is closed under the 'o' binary operation and 'e' is an
    identity element under 'o', then the identity element 'e' is unique

----------------
Inverse Element:
- an element 'a' in 'Omega' is said to have an "inverse element" 'a^(-1)' in
  'Omega' under the binary operator 'o' if and only if:
    "a o a^(-1) = a^(-1) o a = e"
    where 'e' is the identity element in 'Omega'
- to prove:
  - determine the identity element 'e'
  - let 'a' in 'Omega' be arbitrary but fixed
  - compute "a o x" and "x o a"
  - solve for 'x' where "a o x = e = x o a"
  - show that 'x' is in 'Omega'
  - conclude that "a^(-1) = x" is the inverse of the element 'a' under the
    binary operator 'o'
- Theorem:
  - let 'o' be an associative binary operator
  - if 'Omega' is closed under 'o' and 'a^(-1)' is in 'Omega' whenever 'a'
    is in 'Omega', then 'a^(-1)' is unique
- Theorem:
  - if 'Omega' is closed under 'o' and 'a^(-1)' is in 'Omega' whenever 'a'
    is in 'Omega', then "(a^(-1))^(-1) = a"

---------
Function:
- a function 'f' defined on a subset 'D' of the set of real numbers is
  called a "real valued function" if and only if 'f' is a rule that assigns
  to each 'x' in 'D' one and only on real number 'y'
- the set 'D' is called the "domain" of the function 'f'
- Equality:
  - two functions 'f' and 'g' are said to be equal if and only if they have
    the same domain 'D' and "f(x) = f(x) for all x in D"
- Composition:

- a statement that can be shown, using a given set of axioms and
  definitions, to be both true and false
- often used to show the inconsistencies in a flawed theory (Russell's
  paradox)
- often used informally to describe a surprising or counterintuitive result
  that follows from a given set of rules (Banach-Tarki paradox, Alabama
  paradox, Gabriel's horn)
