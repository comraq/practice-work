--------------------
Inductive Reasoning:
- the method of reasoning based on making inferences and conclusions from
  observations to a more general conclusion or future event

--------------------
Deductive Reasoning:
- the method of reasoning where a conclusion is reached by logical arguments
  based on a collection of assumptions

----------------
Axiom/Postulate:
- a mathematical statement that is taken to be self-evidently true without
  proof
- these are basic building blocks from which all theorems are proved

-----------------------
Mathematical Definition:
- a statement that gives precise meaning to a mathematical concept, word or
  term
- it characterizes the meaning of the word by giving all the properties and
  only those properties that must be true

-----------
Conjecture:
- any mathematical statement that has not yet been proved or disproved

------
Proof:
- a proof of a mathematical result is a sequence of rigorous mathematical
  arguments that are presented in a clear and concise fashion
- convincingly demonstrates the truth of a given result

--------
Theorem:
- any mathematical statement that can be shown to be true using accepted
  logical and mathematical arguments

------
Lemma:
- a minor result whose sole purpose is to help in proving a theorem
- any provable result that is used primarily as a necessary step in the
  proof of another theorem
- a stepping stone on the path to proving a theorem
- very occasionally lemmas can take on a "life of their own" (Zorn's lemma,
  Urysohn's lemma, Burnside's lemma, Sperner's lemma)

----------
Corollary:
- a theorem that can be stated as a special case of a more general theorem
- a result in which the (usually short) proof relies heavily on a given
  theorem
- often say that "this is a corollary of Theorem A"

------
Claim:
- an assertion that is then proved
- often used like an informal lemma

------------------------------
Logical Statement/Proposition:
- a declarative sentence that is either true or false

-----------------------
Propositional Function:
- a declarative sentence 'P(x)' involving a variable 'x' that takes on
  values in a set 'Delta' is said to be a "propositional function" if and
  only if 'P(x)' has a well-defined truth value for each value of 'x' in
  'Delta'
- the set 'Delta' is called the "domain" of the propositional function 'P(x)'

-------------------------------------
Variables in Propositional Functions:
- any term in a propositional function whose value is not explicitly stated,
  implied or understood and whose value is needed in order to determine the
  truth or falsity of the propostion
- the values of a variable is called the "domain" of the propositional
  function and is denoted by 'Delta'

-------------------
Compound Statement:
- combined from simple logical statements that is based on more than one
  object and the use of logical operators

------------------
Logical Operators:
- Let 'P' and 'Q' be statements:
  - 'P AND Q' is called the "conjunction" or "meet" of the statements 'P'
    and 'Q'
  - 'P OR Q' is called the "disjunction" or "join" of the statements 'P' and
    'Q'
  - 'NOT P' is called the "negation" of the statement 'P'

----------
Tautology:
- a statement that is always true for all of its states of nature

--------------
Contradiction:
- a statement that is always false for all of its states of nature

---------------------
Logically Equivalent:
- two statements 'X' and 'Y' are "logically equivalent" when they have
  identitcal truth tables

----------------------
Conditional Statement:
- let 'P' and 'Q' be statements, then the declarative sentence "P implies Q"
  is called a "conditional statement"

-------------------------
Converse Statement:
- the converse of the statement "P implies Q" is "Q implies P"
- Note: a statement and its converse are not logically equivalent

-------------------------
Contrapositive Statement:
- the contrapositive of the statement "P implies Q" is "not P implies not Q"
- Note: a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent

------------------------
Biconditional Statement:
- let 'P' and 'Q' be statements, the "biconditional statement" is "P if and
  only if Q", or "P iff Q"
- Note: "P iff Q" is only true if both "P implies Q" and its converse "Q
        implies P" is true

-------------------------
Universal Quantification:
- clauses for universal quantification include:
  - for every
  - for each
  - for all
- Note: negating a statement with an universal quantifier is a statement
        with an existential quantifier with the associated propositional
        function negated

---------------------------
Existential Quantification:
- clauses for existential quantification include:
  - there exists
  - there is at least one
  - there is some
- Note: negating a statement with an existential quantifier is a statement
        with an universal quantifier with the associated propositional function
        negated

---------
Identity:
- a mathematical expression giving the equality of two (often variable)
  quantities
- ex: (trigonometric identities, Euler's identity)

--------
Paradox:
- a statement that can be shown, using a given set of axioms and
  definitions, to be both true and false
- often used to show the inconsistencies in a flawed theory (Russell's
  paradox)
- often used informally to describe a surprising or counterintuitive result
  that follows from a given set of rules (Banach-Tarki paradox, Alabama
  paradox, Gabriel's horn)
