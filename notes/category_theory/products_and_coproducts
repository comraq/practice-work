Products

Given objects A and B in Category C, a Product of them is given by:

 Product Diagram

 +------v------+
 |      |      |
 |      |      |
 |      h      |
 |      |      |
f|      |      |g
 |      V      |
 |  +---u---+  |
 |  |       |  |
 |  |       |  |
 |  |       |  |
 |  V       V  |
 +->A       B<-+

where
- p, q, f and g are (projection) maps
- h is a unique factorization (up to unique isomorphism)
  - ie: both sides of the triangle (rectangles) must be commutative (changing
        the order of the operands does not change the result)

In words, given by projection maps from u to both A and B, such that for all
projection maps from v to both A and B, there exists a unique factorization
h from v to u

Note: v and u are parallel to each other, as both contain projection maps
      from A and B. Hence the relation between them is that there exists a
      unique factorization h.

Note: When stating/identitifying a "Universal Property", this usually
      indicate the presence of a unique morphism somewhere, illustrating a
      commutative property.

Examples:

Cartesian Products of Sets:

A x B = { (a, b) | a in A and b in B }
A x B = [ (a, b) | a <- A, b <- B ] (Haskell List Comprehension)

 +------v------+
 |      |      |
 |      |      |
 |      h      |
 |      |      |
f|      |      |g
 |  p   V   q  |
 |  +-A x B-+  |
 |  |       |  |
 |  |       |  |
 |  |       |  |
 |  |       |  |
 +--A       B--+

where h = (f(v), g(v)) to yield (a, b) pairs from v -> A x B

B x A = { (b, a) | b in B and a in A }
  is not strictly the same set as A x B (as the pairs are reversed)

Topological Spaces:
- Product Topology

Groups:
- Cartesian Product of Groups

Abelian Groups:
- Cartesian Product, same as Direct Sum (as Direct Sum is both the product and
  coproduct in Abelian Groups)
- Note: In general, sums are the categorical dual to products

Vector Spaces:
- Cartesian Product, same as Direct Sum

Category of Categories:
- Cartesian products of the objects and morphisms within the categories
  where objects = (a, b)
        morphisms (f, g) are (a, b) --(f, g)--> (a', b')

Totally Ordered Sets:
- the best possible element that is smaller than both x and y in x X y
  - which is simply the minimum of x or y

Partially Ordered Sets (Posets):
- also the best possible element, the greatest lower bound, in x X y

Note: In general, Tensor products are not categorical products (much like
      how tensor products are distinguished from cartesian products)

Note: On the contrary, Cartesian and Categorical Products, generally can be
      a kind of Tensor Product
----------
Uniqueness

Because products from categories such as the Cartesian Product from the
category of Sets are categorical products, A x B are often used to denote
the product in Category Theory as well.

However, note that unlike the Cartesian Product in Sets, where each A x B is
unique, in Category Theory, A x B are only unique up to isomorphism (there
can be many products that satisfies the categorical product A x B, just
canonically isomorphic to each other).


----------------------
Canonically Isomorphic

For products to be canonically isomorphic, the entire Product Diagram must
be commutative, not just the A x B product (object).
- ie: the 'h' (the unique factorization) must be a morphism that allows the
      entire Product Diagram to commute
- ex:
  - Sets
    - let A = {1, 2} x {3, 4} = { (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4) }
    - this is just a 4-element Set, isomorphic to ALL other 4-element Sets
      (in terms of categorical products) but obviously not the same other
      4-element sets in Set Theory
    - let B = { x, y, orange, monkey }
      - another 4-element set, isomorphic to Set A and can be expressed as
        the prodcut of {1, 2} x {3, 4} by providing/equipping with the corresponding 
        projection maps (ie: f, g from the product Diagram)
        ie: - x maps to (1, 3)
            - y maps to (1, 4)
            - orange maps to (2, 3)
            - monkey maps to (2, 4)
      - this mapping gives us a unique isomorphism between A and B, without which the
        isomorphism between any 4-element sets are not unique (the above
        specific mapping gives up the unique isomorphism)
    - Note: The two sets are not unique, but also not only unique up to an
            isomorphism, but unique up to an unique isomorphism

Co-Products

The dual of Categorical Products:

 Co-Product Diagram

 +----->v<-----+
 |      ^      |
 |      |      |
 |      |      |
 |      h      |
 |      |      |
f|   p  |  q   |g
 |  +-->u<--+  |
 |  |       |  |
 |  |       |  |
 |  |       |  |
 |  |       |  |
 +--A       B--+

where as p, q, f and g where projection maps in Categorical Products, they
are insertion maps in Co-Products

- Like Products, co-products are unique up to unique isomorphism,
  canonically isomorhpic (entire diagrams commute)

ex:
   - Sets
     - Co-Products are Disjoint Unions in Set Theory
     - Any element a in A is mapped to v by f(a), likewise for b in B by g(b)
   - Topological Spaces
     - Disjoint Unions are categorical Co-Products
   - Groups
     - Free Products (in Group Theory) are categorical Co-Products
   - Abelian Groups
     - Direct Sums are categorical Co-Products
   - Vector Spaces
   - Poset
     - Co-Product is the (sup/join) least upper bound of X where X is a poset

Products - Essence

- (Co-)Product Diagram
  - Note: h is sometimes also known as (f, g) as
          (f, g)(v0) = ( f(v), g(v) ) in Set Theory

- Special Case
  - v = A, u = A x A
  - Product Digram Below

      +------A------+
      |      |      |
      |      |      |
      |      d      |
      |      |      |
    id|      |      |id
      |  p   V   q  |
      |  +-A x A-+  |
      |  |       |  |
      |  |       |  |
      |  |       |  |
      |  |       |  |
      +--A       A--+

    where d is the Diagonal Map, in Set Theory, d :: a -> (a, a)

- Remark, a mapping from Product to Product (X x Y to A x B)

   X<---X x Y--->Y
   |      |      |
   |      |      |
   |    f x g    |
   |      |      |
  f|      |      |g
   |  p   V   q  |
   |  +-A x B-+  |
   |  |       |  |
   |  |       |  |
   |  |       |  |
   |  |       |  |
   +--A       B--+

   Note: Unlike h in the traditional Product Diagram, f x g acts on a
         product instead of v:
         - (f x g)(x, y) = ( f(x), f(g) )

   Note: This can also be translated to the tradional Product Diagram (from
         (f x g) to (f, g):
 
     v-------+
     |       |
     |       |
     d       |
     |       |
     |       |
   v x v   (f,g)
     |       |
     |       |
   f x g     |
     |       |
     |       |
   A x B<----+

- Products with the Terminal Object
  - With all products, a monoidal structure is produced
  - The Terminal Object can act as the unit object in monoidal structures, 
  - Consider A x 1: (where A is some object and 1 is the terminal object)

  +------V------+
  |      |      |
  |      |      |
  |      |      |
 f|      h      |g
  |      |      |
  |      |      |
  |      V      |
  |   +--A--+   |
  |  p|     |q  |
  |   |     |   |
  |   V     V   |
  +-->A     1<--+

    where p and q are the projection maps in Categorical Products (as
    Products are objects equipped with projection maps).
    - Note: Both p and q are canonical morphisms

    - We can deduce that p === id and q === ! (the unique morphism from any
      object to the Terminal object)
    - We can also deduce that f === id, g === ! and h === f
    - Redrawing the digram, we get:

        +------v------+
        |      |      |
        |      |      |
        |      |      |
       f|      f      |!
        |      |      |
        |      |      |
        |      V      |
        |   +--A--+   |
        |  f|     |!  |
        |   |     |   |
        |   V     V   |
        +-->A     1<--+
      
      Both sides of the diagram is commutative!
