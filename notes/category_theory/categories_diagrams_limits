Limits and "Cones"

Remember that taking the limit of a category is finding a "Universal Cone"
over a particular diagram.
- Find a vertex 'u' that has projection maps to every object in a
  category/diagram, forming a "cone" shape, and that all of the projection
  maps from 'u' to the objects and the morphisms between the objects commute
- Given any other cone vith a vertex 'v', there is an unique factorization
  from 'v' to 'u' (ie: v -- !h --> u)
- where 'u' is the vertex of the universal cone
  ie: - All other cones and projection maps can be expressed in terms of the
        '!h' unique factorization to 'u' then mapping from 'u' to the respective
        objects

Diagrams

A diagram in 'C' of shape 'I' (a category) is a functor D from I -> C
  where
    - 'I' is a category (usually small or finite)
    - think of functor 'D' as taking objects in 'I' and "putting" it in 'C'
      ie: identifying the diagram that is of interest from a category of
          objects thats is identified by a shape 'I'

  ex:
    1) 'I' is of shape:
                .
                |
                |
                |
                V
       . -----> .

       and is then mapped by the functor to a diagram 'C' resembling the
       following:
                b
                |
                g
                |
                V
       a --f--> c

       Note: that taking the limit of such a diagram is known as a 'Pullback'

    2) 'I' is of shape:

          .   . (pair of objects with no morphisms in between)

       mapped by functor to a diagram 'C' of the following:

          a   b

       Note: that taking the limit of this diagram is a 'Product'

    3) 'I' is of shape:

            ---->
          .       .
            ---->

          (pair of objects with two parallel arrows/morphisms in
          between, in the same direction)

       mapped by functor to a diagram 'C' of the following:

            --f-->
          a        b
            --g-->

       Note: that taking the limit of this diagram is an 'Equalizer'

"Cone over a Diagram"

An "cone over a diagram" is some 'Natural Transformation'
- where
  - 'Natural Transformations' are "naturality squares" a four vertices diagram
    where all the morphisms commute



Viewing the 'Natural Transformation' square as a "Triangular" cone:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

  Overview:
  --------
  1) Start with a functor (called "delta") mapping
     everything to 'u' (the vertex of the universal cone)
  2) Another functor mapping from 'u' to the objects of the diagram


  Detailed Process:
  -----------------
  Define a functor:
    Delta_u : I ---> C  (maps the shape 'I' to diagram 'C')
              i ---> u  (maps all object 'i' to 'u' for all 'i' in 'I')
              f ---> id (maps all morphisms with the identity function)

  A cone over a diagram 'D' with vertex 'u' is precisely
  a 'Natural Transformation' of:
    Delta_u ---> D


  Explanation:
  ------------
  For all objects 'i' in the shape 'I':
    (Delta_u(i) === u) -- P(i) --> D(i)


  Such that for all morphisms f from i ---> i' in the shape 'I':
    (Delta_u(i) === u) -- P(i') --> D(i')

    where
      u -- P(i) --> D(i) tells us that there is a projection from every
      'u' (the vertex) to every object i in the diagram 'D'

      u -- P(i') --> D(i') tells us that all the morphisms already in the
      diagram can be expressed in terms of a morphism from 'u' to the new
      object 'i' (ie: the projection maps in the cone are commutative)

  Thus, the 'naturality square' for this Natural Transformation looks like:

    u -- P(i) ---> D(i)
    |                |
    |                |
   id               D(f)
    |                |
    |                |
    V                V
    u -- P(i') --> D(i')

    - this is true as every i (or i') in I maps to u and f maps to id
      as indicated in the defintion of Delta_u
    - although a square, this can also be viewed as a cone shape (triangle)
      due to the id morphism from u --> u
      - thus, the cone from vertex 'u' to a digram 'D' is indeed
        a 'Natural Transformation'
