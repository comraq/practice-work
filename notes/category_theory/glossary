------------------
Inclusion Function
- if S is a subset of a set T, then there is an inclusion function:
    "i: S -> T"
  for which
    "i(x) = x"
  for all x in S

-----------------------------
Restriction and Corestriction
- let 'f' be a function "f: S -> T"
- Restriction:
  - if A is a subset of S, then the restriction of 'f' to A is
    the composite:
      "f o i: A -> T"
    where "i: A -> S" is the inclusion function
- Corestriction
  - if T is a subset of B, 'f' is the corestriction of the composite
    function:
      "j o f: S -> B"
    where "j: T -> B" is the inclusion function
