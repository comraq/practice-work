------------------
Inclusion Function
- if S is a subset of a set T, then there is an inclusion function:
    "i: S -> T"
  for which
    "i(x) = x"
  for all x in S

-----------------------------
Restriction and Corestriction
- let 'f' be a function "f: S -> T"
- Restriction:
  - if A is a subset of S, then the restriction of 'f' to A is
    the composite:
      "f o i: A -> T"
    where "i: A -> S" is the inclusion function
- Corestriction
  - if T is a subset of B, 'f' is the corestriction of the composite
    function:
      "j o f: S -> B"
    where "j: T -> B" is the inclusion function

----------------------------------
Discrete and Indiscrete Categories
- Discrete:
  - a category in which every arrow is an identity arrow
  - a category 'A' is discrete if and only if for every set function
      "F: A_0 -> B_0" where 'B' is any category,
    is the object part of a unique functor from 'A' to 'B'
- Indiscrete:
  - a category in which there is exactly one arrow between any two objects
  - a category 'B' is indiscrete if and only if for every set function
      "F: A_0 -> B_0" where 'A' is any category,
    is the object part of a unique functor from 'A' to 'B'

-----------------
Idempotent Arrows
- an arrow "f: A -> A" in a category is idempotent if "f o f = f"

-------------------
Groupoid Categories
- a category in which every arrow is an isomorphism
- ie: every arrow 'f: A -> B' has an inverse arrow 'g: B -> A' for objects
      'A' and 'B' such that:
        f o g = id_B
        g o f = id_A
