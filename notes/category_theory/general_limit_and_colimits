Limits

Taking the Categorical Limit is taking the limit of a diagram. A limit for a
diagram in category C is a universal cone over the digram (where the
universal cone means the best possible cone).

Consider the following diagram:


       + --------------------+
       |                     |
       |                     |
       u ----------> .       |
       |             ^       |
       |             |       |
       |             |       |
       +-------+     |       |
       |       |     |       |
       |       |     |       |
       V       V     |       |
       . ----> . ----+       |
               |     |       |
               |     |       |
               |     V       |
               |     . <-----+
               |     ^       |
               |     |       |
               V     |       |
               . ----+       |
               ^             |
               |             |
               |             |
               +-------------+

  where:
    - every '.' (or x) is an object in the category
    - 'u' is a vertex/object that has a projection map to every 'x'
      and every 'triangle' formed by the projection maps (morphisms) to other
      projection maps is commutative
      - ie: for all morphisms u ---> x and such that for all morphisms f in
            the following diagram
              u ---> x
              |      |
              |      |
              |      f
              |      |
              |      |
              |      V
              +----> y
            are commutative
            - where x and y are objects in the category

    - suppose there exists another vertex 'v' that has projection maps to
      all objects ('.'s, or 'x's) in the diagram, there exists an unique
      factorization from 'v' to 'u' that commutes with each vertex's
      projection map to the objects

    - the best possible 'cone' (ie: vertex u) is one where all other vertices'
      projection maps all factors uniquely through the morphisms from u to all
      objects
      - ie: 'Universal cone' means given any cone there exists an unique
            v --- h ---> u (factorization)
            - v ------> u
              |         |
              |         |
              |         |
              +--> x <--+
              must commute

    - the best possible 'cone' (formed by the vertex 'u'), sums up/captures
      the 'entirety' of the diagram
