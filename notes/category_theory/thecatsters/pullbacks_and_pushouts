Pullbacks

A "simple" form of limits.

A pullback is given by a commuting square, we must start with a pair of projection maps:

  Pullback Diagram (Known as Cartesian Square in French):
    u -- q --> B
    |          |
    |          |
    p          g
    |          |
    |          |
    V          V
    A -- f --> C

  where p, q, f and g are morphisms.
  - The Pullback Diagram must be commutative
  - The morphisms p, q, f and g must be the best possible morphisms.
    ie: Given any other set of morphisms, there must be a unique
        factorization to p, q, f, g (this is the universal property)

  - Suppose there exists another vertex v with projection maps to A and B:

     +----------- t -------+
     |                     |
     |                     V
     v -- h --> u -- q --> B
     |          |          |
     |          |          |
     |          p          g
     |          |          |
     |          |          |
     |          V          V
     +-- s ---> A -- f --> C
    where h is the unique factorization while:
      - v -> u -> A commutes with s
      - v -> u -> B commutes with t

- The Pullback Diagram is a pullback of
    - f along g
    - g along f (by symmetry)
    - A x_c B (read as A cross B over C)

- A pullback is given by a commuting square as drawn in the

Examples

- Sets
     +----------- t -------+
     |                     |
     |                     V
     v -- h --> . -- q --> B
     |          |          |
     |          |          |
     |          p          g
     |          |          |
     |          |          |
     |          V          V
     +-- s ---> A -- f --> C

  - . cannot simply be a cartesian product [ (a, b) | a <- A, b <- B ], because
    both A and B must result in C when applied with f and g respectively
  - . is rather: [ (a, b) | a <- A, b <- B, f(a) == f(b) ]

  - Since v -h-> ., v -s-> A, v -t-> B, and h, s and t are all commutative,
    then h(v) == (s(v), t(v))
    - to prove, we need to check f(s(v)) == g(t(v))
      - since f . s and g . t are commutative, h(v) = (s(v), t(v)) is true

Pushouts

  Pushout Diagram

    C -- g --> B ---------+
    |          |          |
    |          |          |
    f          q          t
    |          |          |
    |          |          |
    V          V          V
    A -- p --> u -- h --> v
    |                     ^
    |                     |
    +------ s ------------+

  where f, g are projection maps and p, q are the best possible (universal
    property) insertion maps

  Note: The universal 'u' in both Pullback and Pushout are usually the
        smallest morphisms
        ie: Any other morphism from 'v' can be composed from the factor 'h'
            and the respective p, q and etc...

  - ex: 
    - Sets - take the disjoint union of A and B (but note that g, q and f, p
             must commute!)
           - Forall c in C, f(c) ~ g(c) (where '~' represents an equivalence relation)
           - Consider the following Set diagram:

             A n B <------> B
               ^            ^
               |            |
               |            |
               |            |
               V            V
               A <------> A u B

             The A n B intersection represents a pullback while A u B union
             represents a pushout
