Terminal and Initial Objects


-----------------
Terminal Objects:

Let C be a category:
- A terminal object in C is an object T in C such that for all X in C, there
  exists a UNIQUE morphism from X -> T (this is the universal property)
    - this is sometimes also known as the final object

- ex:
  - Any 1 (single) element Set is terminal
    - As there can only be 1 morphism (function) from any other set to the
      single element Set
    - {1}, {4}, {3649}
    - Note: There can be many terminal Sets in a category (and mostly
            follows a same pattern)
            Although each are unique, they are only unique up to a
            canonical isomorphism (not exact equality, categorical
            equality)
  - In Groups, the trivial group is terminal
    - Like Sets, there are many trivial troups (too many to make a
      meaningful differentiation between each)
  - In Topolocial Spaces, any 1 point space is terminal
    - Like Spaces, there are many 1 point spaces (too many to make a
      meaningful differentiation between each)
  - In Posets (Partially ordered sets), any maximum element is the terminal
    (a -> b means a < b)

Lemma
- Terminal objects in C are unique up to unique isomorphism
  - If T and T' are terminal, then there exists a unique isomorphism T -> T'
    - Note: Any terminal T also has a unique morphism to itself (identity
            function)
    - Proof:
      - Suppose T and T' are terminal
        - Since T' is terminal, we have unique moprhism T -f-> T'
        - Since T is terminal, we have unique moprhism T' -g-> T

        - Since T is terminal, we have unique morphism T -id-> T
          so in particular T -f-> T' -g-> T === id
        - Since T' is terminal, we have unique morphism T' -id-> T'
          so in particular T' -f-> T -g-> T' === id

        - ie: g . f === id, f . g === id

Note: Some categories do not have Terminal Objects
ex:
    1) obj1 -f-> obj2
       obj1 -g-> obj2
       Comment: No object has a unique morphism from all other objects in
                the category to itself

    2) obj1 -f-> obj2
       obj3 -g-> obj4

    3) obj1 -f-> obj2 -g-> obj3 -h-> obj4 -i-> ...

    4) Fields also do not have Terminal Objects (as 0 /= 1)

Note: Without terminal objects, the category cannot be Monadic


-----------------
Definition - Dual
- Dual is when the direction of arrows in all morphisms (functions) are
  reversed


---------------
Initial Objects

Initial Objects are just the "dual" of Terminal Objects. An initial object
in category C is an object I such that for all X in C, there exists a unique
morphism from I -> X

An initial object in C is the terminal object in C^(op) (Category Opposite)

- ex:
  - In Sets, the Empty Set is initial
  - In Topolocial Spaces, the empty space is initial
  - In Groups, the trivial group is initial
    (note that the trivial group is also the terminal object)
  - In Pointed Sets and Topological Spaces, just like groups, both the
    set/space containing just the base point, is both initial and terminal
  - In Field, there is no initial object

Since Initial Objects are "dual" of Terminal Objects, any properties
(anything true deduced about Terminal Objects), can be "dualized" and shown
for Initial Objects.
- Initial Objects are unique up to unique isomorphism (proof similar to that
  of Terminal Objects)

Note: (Future Hint) All universal properties are initial objects in some
      category

--------
Notation

Terminal Objects are often written as ---- 1   <-   (a kind of Limit)
Initial Objects are often written as  ---- 0   <-   (a kind of Co-Limit)


-------------------------
The "Cat(egory)" Category

In Cat, the empty category is initial
- a cat with precisely one object and one morphism (the only possible
  morphism in this case is the identity function) is terminal
