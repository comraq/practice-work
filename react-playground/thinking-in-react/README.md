A skeleton node project with my preferred gulp-setup to build front end
javascript     

Custom project/app directories are defined in gulp/paths.js      

Commands:     
npm run watchd - watches for src js and css changes, then auto rebuild with
sourcemaps   
npm run watch - watches for src js and css changes, then auto rebuild
without sourcemaps        
npm test - watches for src js changes, then run sanity testSuite
